# Efficient-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-for-Question-Answering
This project builds a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for question answering. Using a sampled dataset of  Natural Questions dataset , making it computationally efficient for testing and development. and the facebook/rag-token-base model, it efficiently retrieves and generates answers.
